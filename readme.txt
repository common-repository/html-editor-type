Uses the lovely M+ 2m font in the HTML post editor for more beautiful typing.

== Description ==

The HTML editor has not received a lot of love. The type is too small, especially when you see it in the new distraction-free writing mode. This plugin uses the lovely [M+ 2m font](http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/mplus-outline-fonts/index-en.html) (the font I use for coding every day) for more beautiful writing.

M+ also has *extensive* international support. [From its site](http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/mplus-outline-fonts/index-en.html#features):

> All fonts were completed with Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A, and IPA Extensions. And most of Greek, Cyrillic, Vietnamese, and extended glyphs and symbols were prepared too. So the fonts are in conformity with ISO-8859-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, Windows-1252, T1, and VISCII encoding.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `html-editor-type` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the "HTML Editor Type" plugin in your WordPress administration interface

3. Create or edit a post using the HTML tab (or just disable visual editing altogether in your user settings page). Marvel at the improvement.
